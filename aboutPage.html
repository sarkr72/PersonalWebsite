            <p class="para"> My name is Rinku Sarkar. I graduated from suffolk Community College. I have been working
                as a freelance web developer for the last three years and cooperated with several startups. I cannot say
                with 100% confidence
                where I see myself in five years or what my big career goal is. The world is changing rapidly, and I
                donâ€™t have enough professional
                experience to be certain about such things. However, I know that I can provide a fresh take and an
                extraordinary approach to every project. </p>
